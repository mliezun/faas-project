# ZIG

This is the language in which *I WANT* to write it. But I can't do it, there's not a lot of projects written in Zig. HTTP server just came out and isn't super mature.

I think I would have to do a lot of things from scratch in order to use it. It's a no-go.

# Rust

I think this is the correct choice. Enforces memory safety. Has a lot of packages in *Cargo*. "Tokio" is great of async/tasks/green threads. Libraries for implementing JIT and parsing/interpreting languages.

It's the clear winner, I can be more confident that I will be able to write code that is more correct using Rust.

# Go

From the 3, is the only one that I have experience. I like it because it's easy and comfortable, but it's clearly not suited for this project because it has great overhead and it's kind of slow when compared to the other two.
